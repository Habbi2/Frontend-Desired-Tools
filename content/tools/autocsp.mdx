AutoCSP ingests a live URL, crawls optionally, fingerprints inline code, and produces both **baseline** and **strict** CSP variants. It highlights risky constructs (wildcards, `unsafe-inline`, missing script hashing) and provides ready-to-paste server / meta / proxy snippets.

### Why it exists
Manually crafting strong CSPs is tedious. AutoCSP reduces iteration time and surfaces tightening opportunities early.

### Core Ideas
- Non-destructive baseline + a harder strict candidate
- Hash-first mindset instead of allowing inline everywhere
- Risk heuristics to motivate incremental tightening

### Quick Start
Enter a URL, review baseline vs strict, copy the snippet you prefer, iterate.
