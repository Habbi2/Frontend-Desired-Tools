Palette Picker is a simple, no-URL playground for designers who just want impressive palettes fast. Pick a primary color, choose a "vibe" mode, and the tool generates a complete, contrast-safe palette with live component previews.

### How it feels
- You choose a color → palettes and components update instantly.
- Modes encode design DNA (contrast, saturation curves, neutral temperature) so results look intentional.
- Guardrails keep text readable; a "Make Accessible" action nudges values to AA.

### What you get
- CSS variables for `:root` and dark mode
- A Tailwind theme snippet
- `tokens.json` for design systems
- A share link encoding your current state (primary, mode, mood, theme)

### Try it locally
- Open `palette-picker/index.html` in your browser.
- Or serve the folder with any static server.

### Roadmap
- Logo color extraction (upload an image → suggested starters)
- More modes (Industrial, Pastel, Monochrome Luxe)
- Token scales (50–900) and exports for Figma JSON / CSS-in-JS
